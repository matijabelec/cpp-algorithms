Variables are named memory locations. We use them to store some data.

How data is stored and read, are described by a type of variable. Type of 
variable specifies variables size in memory.

## Variable types:

bool | 1B | boolean: true/false values (in fact 0 is false; any other value stored in is true)
char | 1B | character: ASCII code of character
int | 4B | used to store integers
float | 4B | used to store decimal numbers (precision on 6 decimal places)
double | 8B/10B | used to store decimal numbers (precision on 9 decimal places)
